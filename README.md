Challenge One: x % n where n is a large prime number is a better hash function as it makes the rest of the function more uniformly distributed and the remainder is usually lower than with a large number with several factors. Ex. 12345%615 is 45, while 12345%617 is only 5.
Challenge Two: char values summed % 599 is a good hash function as it's quick, simple, and effective, and spreads everything uniformly. Some issues could arise however, as it's a simple  function and may lead to clustering and might not perfectly distribute things uniformly all the time.
Challenge Three: When creating a new hashmap, you initialize the hashmap with two input values like (string, string). After that, it assigns a hashcode to the inputs. By using a number and modulating it by a number like: "12345%599", it comes up with an integer value that it uses to determine the index. Though this may lead to collisions at times, in a lot of cases, it leads to an individualized index value, and if there's still a chance of collisions, further scrambling can be done to make an even more individual index value and reduces the chance of collisions even more.
